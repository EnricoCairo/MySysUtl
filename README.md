Library of functions and procedures for MySQL

[ PURPOSE ]

At first, my idea was to write a single file ".sql", but I decided to fall back
on the solution to create a file for each area, in order to make my work easier
to understand.

I decided to develop this library of functions and procedures for all those
Oracle dba who want to approach the world of MySQL.

First of all, let me explain this concept better.
In Oracle databases, usually we talk about schemas, roles and so on; the term
"database" itself can have different meanings: in Oracle we use this term to
address all the files of an instance, while in MySQL engine it's used in the
same way as the word "schema" in Oracle.
